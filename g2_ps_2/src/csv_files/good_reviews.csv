The market we work in can get extremely competitive and it’s important to cut through the noise, quickly. I do this by sending prospects to a reputable source of truth on how users are getting value from what we provide.

Our CSMs have always been extremely responsive. I do not say this lightly when I say, I truly feel like we are the CSMs only clients.

The vendor portal is astronomically easier to use than other review vendors on the market. It's very easy to navigate and it's very easy to identify what needs to be or can be updated on your organization's upgraded product profile listing. 

Implementation was smooth and quick, and each year we renew, the team works hard to lay out only our options that are truly the best for our organization.

Integrations are also very simple. We itegrate with Salesforce, Marketo, Demandbase, Influitive, Salesloft, Pendo, Leandata, and Zoominfo, and each connection was very easy to navigate. Our CSMs helped facilitate all of these integretions and connected us with their in-house ops team as well as provided easy-to-follow instructions to make these integrations run smoothly. They were very patient and made sure to test things multiple times and ensure everything worked perfect. 

Review generation campaigns are also extremely easy to run with G2 and super simple too. We send them a list, a budget, and..that's it. They take it from there. The results we see from these campaigns is better than any other review vendor we use. We get good quality reviews from these efforts which helps us show up well on quarterly reports and earn tons of badges which we frequently use for marketing purposes.

Buyer intent data management is very simple and affective with the G2 portal. We receive leads directly into our internal database and can easily pull reports and list distrobutions of a particular moment in time if we want too. We run several competitor campaings and alwsy use the various G2 intent signals to really hone our target. You can get as broad or as grainular with the targeting with G2 buyer intent data.

That tells me they are already in talks with that competitor and looking to see who else they should consider - enter me!

There are major upsides to using G2 not just for competitive comparisons but also to reflect on what your customer like and/or dislike. This can be great feedback for customer success teams and product teams! It also helps me understand what I need to do a better job of explaining specific features/use cases.

It's a good resource to gather honest feedback from our customers.","However, all the functionalities we can use with the paid version have not yet sparked a lot of enthusiasm in our company. For example, you don't see why a review has been rejected, there's not much going on concerning intent data, and for paid promotions (ads in your category) you need to pay extra PLUS you have to make sure to secure your spot before your competitor, which hasn't been a pleasant experience so far...especially because there wasn't much traffic generated either by these ads.",False,True,G2 Gives Campaign.

The first month we used G2, we were in the leaderboard quadrant as a top 3 solution. We did a big promotion with our top 3 standing that went out to customers and future buyers. After this campaign promoting our G2 standing, our marketing manager realized that G2 had tagged us with the wrong employee count, so we contacted them to fix it. After G2 corrected the employee count, we moved to the lowest ranking offering (down 6 spots) with no other change than our number of employees. G2 met with us to review this error and didn't provide any clarity except that their algorithm emphasizes better scores for larger companies. This logic seems ridiculous because if a company is large, it doesn't mean that the specific product reviewed is superior to a smaller company. Often, smaller companies have superior products because it's their primary focus. G2 promised to get back to us to solve this mistake, but we haven't heard back from them in weeks. We've found the experience with G2 to be very disappointing and borderline dishonest. I'm not hopeful that we'll hear back from them. We've discontinued all promotions of our profile on G2.",False,True,Invitation from G2.
