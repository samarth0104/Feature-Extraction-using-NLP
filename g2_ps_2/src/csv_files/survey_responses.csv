If someone is simply searching on Google for a CRM system, G2 Crowd pops up and offers all these products with REAL customer reviews. I think that is extremely valuable to both shoppers and companies. G2 Crowd gets hundreds to thousands of people scrolling through their site daily, which offers a great amount of awareness to our product.

One other thing I HAVE to praise is the G2 Crowd staff. Bliss Billingsley was incredibly helpful throughout our training/implementation phase and was always quick to email or call when I had questions. Just last week she transitioned us along to Ashley McDermott, our Relationship Manager. While I'm sad to no longer work with Bliss, I'm equally as excited to work with Ashley and improve our ranking even more!","The only complaint I have is that they sent the review emails to our customers back to back. G2 Crowd sends 3 emails to notify your customers to leave reviews and earn gift cards, but I was really hoping we'd be offered the chance to choose the dates of these emails. They sent all 3 emails back to back over a 3 day period, which in my opinion wasn't enough space between emails. Maybe just give customers the option in the future of when to send the emails.

3. The total traffic was way too much to use (1k+ unique companies every few months with conversion rates below 2%), but thankfully you can see exactly what each company is looking at.

However, this turned out to be a very positive experience, because they designed and implemented a new API specific to my needs, and fast. Turns out they could get it to me any way I wanted, I just had to wait a few weeks. I now have a Leads API that gets me the data, how and when I need it. They're already listening to the next product advancements, and I feel confident the product will continue to grow beyond its existing value, which is already at this point quite significant.

The market we work in can get extremely competitive and it’s important to cut through the noise, quickly.

Having a personal dashboard where you can track all reviews, their status on posting as well as the reward payout is also a plus.","Some of our customers did express some frustration with getting the reviews to post, but it most likely was due to user error (not completing email verification or wanting to connect via LinkedIn).  While we did try and coach customers through this, some were not willing to take these additional steps and in turn, caused the reviews not to be posted.

Having this in real-time or close to real-time can really increase my response rate. For example, I see they are looking at comparing vendors to one of my competitors. That tells me they are already in talks with that competitor and looking to see who else they should consider - enter me!

There are major upsides to using G2 not just for competitive comparisons but also to reflect on what your customer like and/or dislike. This can be great feedback for customer success teams and product teams! It also helps me understand what I need to do a better job of explaining specific features/use cases.

I don't like that the last review (video) is automatically the first thing a customer sees, if this isn't a good review but there are 8 others that are, why does it have to be highlighted? I feel like our company should get to choose which video is shown on our main page on G2.

Our CSMs have always been extremely responsive. I do not say this lightly when I say, I truly feel like we are the CSMs only clients.

The vendor portal is astronomically easier to use than other review vendors on the market. It's very easy to navigate and it's very easy to identify what needs to be or can be updated on your organization's upgraded product profile listing. 

Implementation was smooth and quick, and each year we renew, the team works hard to lay out only our options that are truly the best for our organization.

Integrations are also very simple. We itegrate with Salesforce, Marketo, Demandbase, Influitive, Salesloft, Pendo, Leandata, and Zoominfo, and each connection was very easy to navigate. Our CSMs helped facilitate all of these integretions and connected us with their in-house ops team as well as provided easy-to-follow instructions to make these integrations run smoothly. They were very patient and made sure to test things multiple times and ensure everything worked perfect. 

Review generation campaigns are also extremely easy to run with G2 and super simple too. We send them a list, a budget, and..that's it. They take it from there. The results we see from these campaigns is better than any other review vendor we use. We get good quality reviews from these efforts which helps us show up well on quarterly reports and earn tons of badges which we frequently use for marketing purposes.

Buyer intent data management is very simple and affective with the G2 portal. We receive leads directly into our internal database and can easily pull reports and list distrobutions of a particular moment in time if we want too. We run several competitor campaings and alwsy use the various G2 intent signals to really hone our target. You can get as broad or as grainular with the targeting with G2 buyer intent data.

G2 is a tool I use every day so it's something I need to work well all the time. Compared to other review vendors, the portal is always running well and ive experienced little to no system errors.","I really had to think hard to find somewhere G2 falls short and the ONLY thing I've been able to come up with is some of the marketing assets in the vendor portal are only available via HTML embed code and sometimes we need them in JPEG form.
